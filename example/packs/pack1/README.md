# The example pack

This is the directory for the example song pack.

Each song pack's directory should include these:

* A `pack.yaml` file for the metadata of the pack.
* A `pack.png` file as the pack's cover image:
  * A **251 x 503** PNG image file.
  * The bottom-left and bottom-right angles are clipped. You can copy this effect from the example `pack.png` with [this](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/8397/gimp-using-an-image-as-the-transparency-layer-of-another-image) method.
* Some songs directory. See [the example song](song1) for more info.
